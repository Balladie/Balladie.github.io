title: Block Diffusion for Discrete Speech Generation
date: 2026-02-05 00:00:00
description: I have explored how to leverage from block causality applied to the existing autoregressive discrete token-based text-to-speech models. The method accelerates the inference speed of the exising TTS models up to <i>x1.5~x2</i> times compared to the original in a model-native way, while getting minimal degradation on speech quality and zero-shot capability.

    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
